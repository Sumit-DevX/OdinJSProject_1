## Description

A small, console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in JavaScript. Play against the computer from the terminal. This project focuses on clean function design, using Math.random for computer choice, and applying conditional logic to decide round winners.

## Features

- Play rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors in the terminal
- Simple, input-driven loop with basic validation
- Clear separation of logic into reusable functions

## What I learned

- Structuring code with clear, small functions
- Generating random choices with Math.random()
- Implementing game logic using conditional statements
